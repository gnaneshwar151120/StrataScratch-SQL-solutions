# StrataScratch SQL Practice

This repository contains my SQL practice solutions to problems from **StrataScratch**.  
It is maintained as a personal learning log to improve SQL skills through consistent problem solving and hands-on practice.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Practice SQL concepts incrementally
- Maintain a structured record of solved problems
- Revisit and revise solutions as understanding improves
- Build long-term consistency in SQL learning
